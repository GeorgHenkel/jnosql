== Eclipse JNoSQL 1.0.0-b7 Migration Guide

Migrating to the next version of Eclipse JNoSQL is a straightforward process. The primary change in this new version is the removal of the Eclipse JNoSQL driver, which has been replaced by the jnosql-databases repository dependency. The following is a step-by-step guide to help you migrate to the new version:

1. Update the JNoSQL version in your project to the latest version. You can do this by updating the version number in your Maven or Gradle build file or by downloading the new version and replacing the old one.

2. Remove the Eclipse JNoSQL driver dependency from your project. This can be done by removing the dependency declaration from your build file or by deleting the driver library from your project's classpath.

3. Add the jnosql-databases repository dependency to your project. You can do this by adding the appropriate dependency declaration to your build file or by downloading the repository and adding it to your project's classpath.

4. Check the https://github.com/eclipse/jnosql-databases/blob/main/README.adoc[README] file of https://github.com/eclipse/jnosql-databases/blob/main/[jnosql-database] for the new dependency to the database target. This step is essential as it will help you understand how to use the new repository dependency to interact with your target database. The README file will provide you with detailed instructions on how to use the repository dependency to perform database operations.

5. Modify your code to use the new repository dependency. Once you have updated your project and added the new dependency, you need to modify your code to use it. This will involve updating your database access code to use the new repository dependency instead of the Eclipse JNoSQL driver.

6. Test your application to ensure everything is working correctly. Once you have made the necessary changes, you need to test your application to ensure everything is working correctly. This will involve running your application and verifying that it can still access and manipulate your target database.

In conclusion, migrating to the next version of Eclipse JNoSQL is a simple process that involves removing the Eclipse JNoSQL driver dependency and replacing it with the jnosql-databases repository dependency. By following the steps outlined above, you should be able to migrate to the new version without any issues.

== Eclipse JNoSQL 1.0.0-b6 Migration Guide

This migration guide explains how to migrate from Eclipse JNoSQL 1.0.0-b6 to the latest version, taking into account the following two significant changes:

Jakarta EE upgrade to version 9
Reduction of the scope of the Jakarta NoSQL specification to only run on the Mapping.

== Jakarta EE migration

With the new version of Eclipse JNoSQL, you need to use Jakarta EE 9 or higher. There is an impact on the package name due to this upgrade. Therefore, we recommend that you check any third-party libraries that you use that integrate with Jakarta EE and verify if they have EE 9 compatible variants. The most common problems are with projects that import Servlet APIs. However, most well-maintained libraries produce Jakarta EE 9 compatible variants.

Here are some examples of libraries that have already produced Jakarta EE 9 compatible variants:

* Hibernate
* Thymeleaf
* Tomcat
* Jetty
* Undertow

== Jakarta NoSQL scope reduction

The current scope of Jakarta NoSQL has been reduced to only run on the Mapping. The communication has been moved to Eclipse JNoSQL using the package name `org.eclipse.jnosql` instead of `jakarta.nosql`.

Furthermore, the annotations that don't belong to the Jakarta NoSQL specification (Id, Entity, and Column) have moved to the new package name: `org.eclipse.jnosql.mapping`. The new Jakarta NoSQL annotations have moved to the package `jakarta.nosql`. such as `Id` with `jakarta.nosql.Id`.

To migrate to the new version of Eclipse JNoSQL, follow these steps:

* Update your project to use Jakarta EE 9 or higher.
* Update the package name for communication with Eclipse JNoSQL from jakarta.nosql to org.eclipse.jnosql.
* Update the package name for the annotations that don't belong to the Jakarta NoSQL specification from jakarta.nosql to org.eclipse.jnosql.mapping.
* Update the package name for the new Jakarta NoSQL annotations from `org.eclipse.jnosql`  to `jakarta.nosql`.

By following these steps, you should be able to migrate your Eclipse JNoSQL project successfully.
